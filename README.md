# Handwritten Digits Recognition and Prediction using SVD and Logistic Regression

This project implements a handwritten digits recognition system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction and Logistic Regression for classification.

## Introduction
Handwritten digits recognition is a classic machine learning problem that involves recognizing digits (0-9) from images. This project demonstrates how to use SVD for dimensionality reduction combined with Logistic Regression to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
SVD is a powerful technique used for dimensionality reduction. It decomposes a matrix into three other matrices and helps in reducing the number of features while retaining the essential structure of the data.

## Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective classification algorithm. It is particularly useful for binary and multiclass classification problems.
